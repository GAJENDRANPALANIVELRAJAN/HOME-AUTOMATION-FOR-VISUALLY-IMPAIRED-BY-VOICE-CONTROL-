ABSTRACT:
        The project presents a comprehensive solution for enhancing the daily living 
experience of visually impaired individuals through the implementation of a
voicecontrolled home automation system. Leveraging advancements in voice recognition
technology, the system enables users to effortlessly control and monitor various 
smart home devices using natural language commands. The integration of intelligent
sensors, coupled with a user-friendly interface, empowers visually impaired individuals
to independently manage their living environment. The proposed system not only promotes
accessibility but also contributes to a safer and more comfortable home environment for 
those with visual impairments, fostering increased autonomy and improved quality of life. 

OBJECTIVE:
The aim of our project is to enhance the individuals by developing a home automation system, 
driven by voice control technology. This system seeks to provide seamless an control over
various household devices, fostering independence, accessibility, is improved an living 
experiences for the visually impaired.  The aim of the project include: 
	Develop a user-friendly home automation system tailored for individuals with visual impairments.
